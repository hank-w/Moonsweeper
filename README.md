# Moonsweeper
Moonsweeper is my custom take on the classic minesweeper game, with all the features of the original windows version, along with creative maps and design. I also used more runtime and memory efficient algorithims as opposed to the old version on many gameplay elements such as guaranteeing that the first click is not a mine.

Controls:

Left Click - unveil a square/navigate menu

Right Click - flag a square

Middle Click - unveil all squares around block (if enough flags have been placed down around it)
